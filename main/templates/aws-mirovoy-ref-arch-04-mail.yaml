      will cover your primary domain and your primary server (e.g.,

      here, you must also include your primary server. So, if you want the
      cert to cover both this mail server and your web server, you could put

    Type: String
  Banner:
    Default: "$myhostname ESMTP $mail_name"

    Description: "When using getssl certificates, we validate with DNS.
      Sometimes, even after the internal tests are run, the call to the acme
      server fails the nslookup on the txt record that is uses, so we add
      an extra delay. If your finding the same problem, try increasing this
      value."
    Type: Number
  DNSZone:
    Description: 'The Route53 Hosted Zone that includes the mail server. This
      will be used for automatic authorization during the creation process for
      the LetsEncrypt SSL certificate, so it should match the domain of the
      primary mail server. For example, if you put "mx1.mail.example.com" as
      the name of the primary server, then this should be the Hosted Zone ID
      for the "mail.example.com" zone.'

    Default: 6.9
    Description: "Triggers spam evasive actions (e.g., blocks mail). Amavisd
      defaults to 6.9. Flurdy sets it to 8.0. You'll have to play around and
      see how much spam is getting through, vs. how many false positives
      you have."
    Type: Number

    Default: 5000
    Description: 'The UID to be assigned to the user "virtual" which owns all

    Default: 25
    Description: The maximum number of IMAP connections allwed for a user

      says, "Some clients open up more user connections at once than you
      might think.... If your email client gets random failures to connect
      during a session, especially a webmail client like Roundcube, try
      increasing this value."
    Type: Number

    Description: smtpd_hard_error_limit The maximal number of errors
      a remote SMTP client is allowed to make without delivering

      under overload to just 1.
    Type: Number
  HeloTimeout:
    Default: 60s
    Description: smtp_helo_timeout The Postfix SMTP client time
      limit for sending the HELO or EHLO command, and for receiving
      the initial remote SMTP server response. The Postfix default
      is 300s. Flurdy changes this to 60s. Not sure why, but it seems to work
      for us. The default time unit is s (seconds).
    Type: String

    AllowedValues:
      - ipv4
      - ipv6
      - all
    Default: ipv4
    Description: Support for IPv4 or IPv6. Postfix default config has "all",

      karl@example.com. example.com and example.net are both created as
      domains, and all mail for example.net is forwarded to
      xandros@example.com. All mail for karl@example.com is forwarded to an
      external email you specify."

      Time units are s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).
    Type: String
  MaxQueueLifetime:
    Default: 5d
    Description: maximal_queue_lifetime How long to keep messages
      on queue before returning as failed.  Five days is pretty
      normal, but there's nothing wrong with adjusting it up or
      down if you have reason (e.g., your serving mail for people
      who often go away for a week at a time and leave their server
      off). Specify 0 when mail delivery should be tried only once.
      Time units are s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).
    Type: String
  MinBackoffTime:
    Default: 300s

    Default: "mail/"
    Description: 'S3 key prefix for the Mirovoy CloudFormation assets. This

      assets for this template (e.g., scripts directory, etc... are located)'
    Type: String
  Origin:
    AllowedValues:
      - domain
      - host
    Default: domain
    Description: myorigin For unix users on this machine posting
      mail, what to append to the username? The full hostname or
      the domain name?  Probably the domain name, but keep in mind
      that this will be weird for root@
    Type: String
  RelayHost:
    Default: ''
    Description: "Leave blank if this mail server sends all outbound mail. If
      you need to relay, e.g., through your ISP's server, enter that here."

  RecipientLimit:
    Default: 50
    Description: smtpd_recipient_limit The maximal number of
      recipients that the Postfix SMTP server accepts per message
      delivery request. The actual Postfix default is 1000; Flurdy
      changes it to 16 because "effective stopper to mass spammers,
      accidental copy in whole address list", but we find we regularly
      send to more than 16 recipients in a single message.
    Type: String
  RootMailRecipient:
    Description: The recipient for local root mail. It can be a
      user on this machine (e.g., the user added as AltAdmin above),
      in which case you'll need to log into the machine locally and
      get check your mail periodically. Or, it can be a real email
      address; or better, a real email distribution list (e.g.,
      sysadmins@example.com) that goes to people who will read such
      messages.
    Type: String
  SoftErrLimit:
    Default: 3
    Description: smtpd_soft_error_limit The number of errors a
      remote SMTP client is allowed to make without delivering mail
      before the Postfix SMTP server slows down all its responses.
      The Postfix default is 10, and you may want to set it to that,
      or even higher, while you're testing your deployment, so you
      don't get slowed down, but once things are working properly
      you should definitely come lower it

      - 550
    Default: 550
    Description: What code to send if local lookup on an address fails. Should
      be 550 (reject mail), but is often worth setting to 450 (try again later)

          # with those IDs. Since we need the GID early (to include here
